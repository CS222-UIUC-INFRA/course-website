This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Branch naming policy
Each of the branches needs to follow the pattern feat/ or bug/ or test/. Any branch names other than these will not be merged.

On cloning the repository, run the command 
```bash
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Make sure you have Node LTS version installed. (v18.18.0 at the time of creating this repo)

Make sure you have "yarn" installed globally. Use `npm i -g yarn` to install yarn globally.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
